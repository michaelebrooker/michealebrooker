- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike Brooker @michaelebrooker
- 👀 I’ve been working in web development since the mid-1990s, and I like Hugo and I'm building my skills with this very flexible, if complex, tool. Deploy on netlify is my default. 
- 🌱 I moved over to using hugo because it's part of the Jamstack vector, which makes a lot of sense. There are other static-site compilers but hugo is nice because it just works without any fuss. I build multi-page websites for local community and voluntary organisations. I do also use node with gulp with sass comp and browser-sync for some Bootstrap-based theme template development.
