- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike Brooker @michaelebrooker
- 👀 I’ve been working in web development since the mid-1990s, and interested in building sites in Hugo and building my skills with this very flexible, if complex, tool. Deploy on netlify is my default. 
🌱 I moved over to using hugo because it's part of the Jamstack vector, which makes a lot of sense. There are other static-site compilers but hugo is nice because it just works. I want to make multi-page websites for community organisations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
